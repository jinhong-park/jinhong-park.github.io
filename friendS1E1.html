"Monica Geller: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!",
"Joey Tribbiani: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!",
"Chandler Bing: So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?",
"Phoebe Buffay: Wait, does he eat chalk?",
"Phoebe Buffay: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!",
"Monica Geller: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.",
"Chandler Bing: Sounds like a date to me.",
"Chandler Bing: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.",
"All: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.",
"Chandler Bing: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Instead of...?. Chandler Bing...  That's right. Joey Tribbiani.... Never had that dream",
"Chandler Bing: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!",
"Ross Geller: (mortified) Hi.",
"Joey Tribbiani: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.",
"Monica Geller: Are you okay, sweetie?",
"Ross Geller: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...",
"Chandler Bing: Cookie?",
"Monica Geller: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Ohh.",
"Monica Geller: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.",
"Ross Geller: Thanks.",
"Phoebe Buffay: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)",
"Ross Geller: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?",
"Ross Geller: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.",
"Monica Geller: No you don't.",
"Ross Geller: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!",
"Joey Tribbiani: And you never knew she was a lesbian...",
"Ross Geller: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?",
"Chandler Bing: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?",
"Joey Tribbiani: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?",
"Joey Tribbiani: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!",
"Ross Geller: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!",
"Chandler Bing: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)",
"Monica Geller: Rachel?!",
"Rachel Green: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!",
"Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?, Monica Geller ..... De-caff.",
"Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?",
"Rachel Green: Hi, sure!   Ross Geller.... Hi. ",
"Monica Geller: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?",
"Rachel Green: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding.",
"I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat.",
"This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?-",
"I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry!",
"And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me. how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean,",
"I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.",
"(to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.",
"Monica Geller: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.",
"Rachel Green: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...",
"Monica Geller: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.",
"Rachel Green: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!",
"Chandler Bing: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.",
"Joey Tribbiani: I say push her down the stairs.",
"Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey Tribbiani: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!",
"Rachel Green: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'.",
"And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe?",
"What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat!",
"No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",
"Ross Geller: You can see where he'd have trouble.",
"Rachel Green: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.",
"Monica Geller: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...",
"Rachel Green: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money.",
"Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!",
"Monica Geller: Just breathe, breathe… that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...",
"Phoebe Buffay: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens...",
"La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...",
"Rachel Green: I'm all better now. Phoebe Buffay..... I helped!",
"Monica Geller: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence.",
"Taking control of your life.",
"Joey Tribbiani: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey.",
"Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.",
"Monica Geller: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!",
"Joey Tribbiani: What, like there's a rule or something?",
"Chandler Bing: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.",
"Paul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.",
"Monica Geller: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!",
"Joey Tribbiani: Who's Paul?",
"Ross Geller: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul? Monica Geller: Maybe.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?",
"Ross Geller: He finally asked you out?",
"Monica Geller: Yes!",
"Chandler Bing: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.",
"Monica Geller: Rach, wait, I can cancel...",
"Rachel Green: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!",
"Monica Geller: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?",
"Ross Geller: (choked voice) That'd be good...",
"Monica Geller: (horrified) Really?",
"Ross Geller: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!",
"Monica Geller: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.",
"All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!",
"Chandler Bing: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?",
"Monica Geller: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...",
"Ross Geller: A wandering?",
"Monica Geller: Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.",
"Phoebe Buffay: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Hey, Paul!",
"Paul: Yeah?",
"Joey Tribbiani: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.",
"Monica Geller: (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!",
"Ross Geller: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?",
"Rachel Green: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!",
"Ross Geller: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.",
"Chandler Bing: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it.",
"Rachel Green: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.",
"Ross Geller: Okay, sure.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?",
"Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.",
"Commercial Break",
"[Scene: The Subway, Phoebe is singing for change.]",
"Phoebe Buffay: (singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!",
"[Scene: Ross's Apartment, the guys are there assembling furniture.]",
"Ross Geller: (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.",
"(Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling the bookcase.)",
"Joey Tribbiani: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.",
"Chandler Bing: It's a beautiful thing.",
"Joey Tribbiani: (picking up a leftover part) What's this?",
"Chandler Bing: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Which goes where?",
"Chandler Bing: I have no idea.",
"(Joey checks that Ross is not looking and dumps it in a plant.)",
"Joey Tribbiani: Done with the bookcase!",
"Chandler Bing: All finished!",
"Ross Geller: (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.",
"Chandler Bing: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?",
"Ross Geller: You guys.",
"Chandler Bing: Oh, God.",
"Joey Tribbiani: You got screwed.",
"Chandler Bing: Oh my God!",
"[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are eating.]",
"Monica Geller: Oh my God!",
"Paul: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?",
"Monica Geller: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?",
"Paul: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-",
"Monica Geller: -leg?",
"Paul: (laughing) That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.",
"Monica Geller: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.",
"Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you.",
"Monica Geller: That's right. [Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]",
"Rachel Green: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)",
"[Scene: Ross's Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and Chandler are working on some more furniture.]",
"Ross Geller: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!",
"Joey Tribbiani: Shut up!",
"Chandler Bing: You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)",
"Ross Geller: That only took me an hour.",
"Chandler Bing: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!",
"Ross Geller: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...",
"Joey Tribbiani: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!",
"Ross Geller: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.",
"Chandler Bing: Stay out of my freezer!",
"[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]",
"Paul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...",
"Monica Geller: What?... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?",
"Paul: No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.",
"Monica Geller: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?",
"Paul: Isn't there?",
"Monica Geller: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?",
"Paul: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually.",
"Monica Geller: (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",
"Paul: It's okay...",
"Monica Geller: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?",
"Paul: Two years.",
"Monica Geller: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!",
"Paul: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?",
"Monica Geller: (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.",
"[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is watching Joanne Loves Chaci.]",
"Priest on TV: We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.",
"Rachel Green: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!",
"[Scene: Ross's Apartment, they're all sitting around and talking.]",
"Ross Geller: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?",
"Joey Tribbiani: Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)",
"Chandler Bing: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)",
"Ross Geller: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out, ... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)",
"[Cut to Rachel staring out of her window.]",
"Commercial Break",
"[Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is making coffee for Joey and Chandler.]",
"Rachel Green: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.",
"Chandler Bing: That is amazing.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Congratulations.",
"Rachel Green: Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.",
"Chandler Bing: If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...",
"Monica Geller: (entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.",
"All: Morning. Good morning.",
"Paul: (entering from Monica's room) Morning.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Morning, Paul.",
"Rachel Green: Hello, Paul.",
"Chandler Bing: Hi, Paul, is it?",
"(Monica and Paul walk to the door and talk in a low voice so the others can't hear.  The others move Monica's table closer to the door so that they can.)",
"Paul: Thank you!  Thank you so much!",
"Monica Geller: Stop!",
"Paul: No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.",
"Monica Geller: We'll talk later.",
"Paul: Yeah. (They kiss) Thank you. (Exits)",
"Joey Tribbiani: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?",
"Monica Geller: Shut up, and put my table back.",
"All: Okayyy! (They do so.)",
"Chandler Bing: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...",
"Rachel Green: So, like, you guys all have jobs?",
"Monica Geller: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Yeah, I'm an actor.",
"Rachel Green: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?",
"Joey Tribbiani: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.",
"Monica Geller: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.",
"Joey Tribbiani: Look, it was a job all right?",
"Chandler Bing: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'",
"Joey Tribbiani: I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)",
"Chandler Bing: You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) 'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...'",
"Joey Tribbiani: You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)",
"Monica Geller: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.",
"Rachel Green: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.",
"Monica Geller: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?",
"Rachel Green: Oh, yeah.",
"Monica Geller: Well, it's like that. With feelings.",
"Rachel Green: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.",
"Monica Geller: Big time!",
"Rachel Green: Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.",
"Monica Geller: I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.",
"Rachel Green: Oh, look, wish me luck!",
"Monica Geller: What for?",
"Rachel Green: I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things.",
"(Monica exits.)",
"[Scene: Iridium, Monica is working as Frannie enters.]",
"Frannie: Hey, Monica!",
"Monica Geller: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?",
"Frannie: You had sex, didn't you?",
"Monica Geller: How do you do that?",
"Frannie: Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?",
"Monica Geller: You know Paul?",
"Frannie: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.",
"Monica Geller: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?",
"Frannie: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.",
"[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Rachel is there.]",
"Joey Tribbiani: (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!",
"Monica Geller: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",
"Ross Geller: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.",
"Monica Geller: I hate men!  I hate men!",
"Phoebe Buffay: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.",
"Monica Geller: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?",
"Phoebe Buffay: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)",
"Monica Geller: I just thought he was nice, y'know?",
"Joey Tribbiani: (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!",
"(Monica pushes him off of the sofa as Rachel enters with a shopping bag.)",
"Rachel Green: Guess what?",
"Ross Geller: You got a job?",
"Rachel Green: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.",
"Chandler Bing: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.",
"Rachel Green: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!",
"Chandler Bing: Oh, how well you know me...",
"Rachel Green: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!",
"Monica Geller: How'd you pay for them?",
"Rachel Green: Uh, credit card.",
"Monica Geller: And who pays for that?",
"Rachel Green: Um... my... father.",
"[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is sitting around the kitchen table.   Rachel's credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]",
"Rachel Green: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.",
"Monica Geller: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.",
"Rachel Green: I know that. That's why I was getting married.",
"Phoebe Buffay: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.",
"Rachel Green: Thank you.",
"Phoebe Buffay: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.",
"(Pause)",
"Ross Geller: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...",
"Monica Geller: All right, you ready?",
"Rachel Green: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  'Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?'  Come on, I can't do this!",
"Monica Geller: You can, I know you can!",
"Rachel Green: I don't think so.",
"Ross Geller: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)",
"Ross Geller: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...",
"All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)",
"Rachel Green: Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...",
"Monica Geller: Rachel!  That was a library card!",
"All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..",
"Chandler Bing: (as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.",
"(She finishes cutting them up and they all cheer.)",
"Monica Geller: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!",
"[Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it's broadcast day by playing the national anthem.]",
"Monica Geller: Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?",
"Ross Geller: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.",
"Monica Geller: You be okay?",
"Ross Geller: Yeah.",
"Rachel Green: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?",
"Monica Geller: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.",
"Ross and Rachel Green: Goodnight.",
"(Monica stomps on Paul's watch and goes into her room.)",
"Ross Geller: Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-",
"Rachel Green: Sorry-",
"Ross Geller: No no no, go-",
"Rachel Green: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-",
"Ross Geller: Split it?",
"Rachel Green: Okay.",
"Ross Geller: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.",
"Rachel Green: I knew.",
"Ross Geller: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.",
"Rachel Green: I did.",
"Ross Geller: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",
"Rachel Green: Yeah, maybe...",
"Ross Geller: Okay... okay, maybe I will...",
